"""
Requirement 4: Best-of-Both-Worlds with Multiple Products
Assigned to: Maxence Guyot

This experiment evaluates the Primal-Dual algorithm with inventory constraint
on two types of multi-product environments:
1. A stationary stochastic environment
2. A highly non-stationary environment with fast-changing valuations

The goal is to test the algorithm's adaptability in both settings.
